  <li>Preparation: Heat oven to 375 degrees F. Line muffin pan wells with liners.
    <li> 1. In a bowl mix together flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt; set aside. In a second bowl mix together sour cream, buttermilk, vanilla extract and lemon zest; set aside.
    <li> 2. Place butter and sugar in an electric mixer bowl fitted with a paddle attachment and mix on medium-high  until pale and fluffy, about 2-3 minutes. Make sure to scrape down the sides of the bowl halfway through. Turn the mixer down to medium and add in one egg at a time, making sure each egg is fully incorporated before adding in the next one. Add the dry ingredients and the wet ingredients to the batter in 3 additions, alternating with wet and dry and ending with dry. Do not over mix. Toss blueberries with 1 tablespoon of flour, using a wooden spoon or a sturdy spatula fold blueberries into batter.
    <li> 3. Evenly divide the batter between 12 wells and sprinkle tops with coarse sugar. Bake at 375 degress F for about 23-26 minutes or until muffins are golden and baked through (to test, insert a cake tester in the middle of a muffin some crumbs maybe present, but no wet batter should be).
